# Kernel-Ioctl


this is a ioctl kernel driver i was originally gonna attempt to use it for my Internal injector for rust + apex + r6 but i gave up half way writing the full method it 



functions

- Read Memory
- Write Memory
- Free Memory
- Allocate memory
- get moculde info
- get module base


everything you really need for a nice IOCTL driver it works 



to compile do x64 -> Release



hope some one else can find this useful 

( the full source isnt mine i based it off injDrv but rewrote it to work with cheat )
